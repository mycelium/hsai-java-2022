We'll be dancin' with the shadows in the night
The stars are jealous knowing that you're by my side
Feel the adrenaline, acceleration
In the course, we'll be drivin' so rough
Ride like the motions of the ocean
High tide in the moonlight
One way emotion, satisfaction
(Skrrt, skrrt) We ain't stopping now
