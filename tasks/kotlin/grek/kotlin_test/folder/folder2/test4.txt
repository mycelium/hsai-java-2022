There is no practical limit to the number of floors, or levels, in the Skull Cavern.[1] Similar to the Mines, the player advances through floors in the Skull Cavern by finding a ladder on each floor, either by mining rocks or defeating enemies.
The player can sometimes find a shaft, or hole, which makes it possible to skip 3-15 floors. There is a 20% chance for a rock to spawn a shaft instead of a ladder. The way this works is that a pseudo random integer x between 3 and 8 inclusive is chosen with a 90% chance that the player drops x levels and a 10% chance that the player drops 2x-1 levels. The amount of levels dropped is predetermined based on the mine level, game day, and game seed. In particular, Luck does not affect the chances of jumping down a certain number of levels. In addition, this means that if there are multiple shafts on a given level, they will drop the player the same number of levels, so it does not matter which shaft is chosen. Jumping down the shaft causes health damage equal to 3x the number of levels skipped (although jumping down a shaft will never reduce health to less than 1). Note that if the player has not reached floor 100 in a given Skull Cavern run and a shaft is calculated to drop the player past floor 100, it will be modified to only drop the player to floor 100.

Unlike the Mines, there is no elevator to save progress, but on every floor there is a ladder at the starting point where the player can leave the Skull Cavern. Each visit must start again from the first floor. If the player runs out of health while exploring Skull Cavern, they will wake up sometime later on the same day in Harvey's Clinic. A fee of Gold.png1,000g will be deducted for emergency surgery. Some items may also be lost. Passing out at 2:00 am will cause the player to lose Gold.png1,000g or 10% of funds, whichever is less.
